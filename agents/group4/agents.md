### Setup

1. Create a file called `.env` at root level (`ai-and-games/.env`)

2. Add the line `GEMINI_API_KEY=` then paste in your api key from gemini

3. The docker file should install `google-generativeai`, if you still get an error, run `pip install google-generativeai` inside the container shell.
